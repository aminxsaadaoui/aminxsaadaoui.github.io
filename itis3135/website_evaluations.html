            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>Apple is a great example of a modern website that implements the principles of CRAP to work in its favor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Great representation of having lighter colors against darker backgrounds through photos.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: The website maintains consistent navigation, fonts, and design elements
                                                 across all pages, which strengthens the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: An extremely symmetrical design that features positioned photos along a structured grid.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>:  Related elements, such as product descriptions and prices, are grouped together, overall effective design.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">Lingscars</a></h3>
            <p>Lingscars is an extremely chaotic website that ignore the principles of CRAP, as well as the wesbite being overwhelming and an overall poor web design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Poor contrast coming from an blank white background with a hippie style margin along with bright green hyperlinks.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: Consistent repetition of unappealing gifs and elements throughout the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: The site is not aligned from having listings of vehicles in the center as well as in the margins.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: The links on this website are far too compact.</li>
            </ul>
